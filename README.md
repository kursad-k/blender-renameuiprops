Rename the properties like vertex groups

This add-on is for renaming the properties like Vertex Groups. Currently renaming a vertex group in a heavy scene sometimes is almost impossible due to the underlying depsgraph updates during and after ui interactions. This add-on bypasses those UI interactions for easier renaming operation.
